This pedigree database is a specialized database designed to store and manage information about the ancestry of purebred dogs. It essentially functions like a family tree, recording their lineage over several generations. Here's a breakdown of its key functions and purposes:
Recording and Maintaining Information:
The database stores details about individual dogs, including their breed, name, registration number, date of birth, and other relevant information.
Crucially, it also records the parents, grandparents, and even further ancestors of each dog, creating a comprehensive lineage record.
